\usage{
\method{predict}{codacore}(object, newx, asLogits = TRUE, numLogRatios = NA, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A codacore object.}

\item{newx}{A set of inputs to our model.}

\item{asLogits}{Whether to return outputs in logit space
(as opposed to probability space). Should always be set
to TRUE for regression with continuous outputs, but can
be toggled for classification problems.}

\item{numLogRatios}{How many predictive log-ratios to 
include in the prediction. By default, includes the
effects of all log-ratios that were obtained during
training. Setting this parameter to an integer k will
restrict to using only the top k log-ratios in the model.}

\item{...}{Not used.}
